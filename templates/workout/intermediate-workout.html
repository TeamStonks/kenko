      <h1 class="title">Intermediate Routine</h1>
            <p class="para">If you’ve mastered the beginner routine, you’re ready to take on these intermediate moves.
Complete 2 sets of 10 to 15 reps of each exercise below, then move on to the next after 1 minute of rest.
An alternative, more advanced approach is to complete timed rounds. For instance, complete 1 minute of each exercise and repeat the circuit twice.
Compete against yourself to get just 1 or 2 more reps each time you complete the routine.

        <p class="para">Any time you take an exercise to a single leg, you’ll automatically make it harder.<br>
Here, follow the steps for a bridge, but lift one foot off the ground while keeping your leg bent for an intermediate challenge.<br>
Complete the same number of reps on each side.</p>

The same motion is still applicable here, though. Imagine you’re sitting down in a chair by hinging at the hips and pushing your bottom back.</p>
