                            Work from home describes work being done remotely, instead of at an office. The acronym “WFH” is used as a nickname for the concept.
                            Many organizations transitioned their employees from the office to a work from home model during the

                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Traditionally, work is done in an office. A business functions in a physical workspace and work-related tasks are completed by employees at the office itself. This is changing with the progression of digital transformation. As software capabilities become more complex, and business processes come to rely on them more, companies are finding that many of their employees are no longer bound by a physical workplace in order to work efficiently. Instead, telecommuting, or working from home, can be just as efficient.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">1. You can reduce distractions from working remotely. Even though there may be plenty of distractions at home, you have the ability to control them, compared to dealing with a distracted coworker.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">2. Many people notice that working from home helps balance their work and personal life. Since you can deal with both from your workspace at home, managing your kids and work can be done in a snap, whereas in an office, you can only focus on work.</p>

It is great when you don’t have a boss looking over your shoulder all day long. But some people won’t be able to get much work done without that bit of pressure.</p>
